# IB-CS-InternalAssessment
This is the repository for my Computer Science (Higher Level) Internal Assessment for the IB Diploma. 

For my Internal Assessment, I made a Calorie Tracker in Java using Eclipse, with a graphical user interface utilizing Java Swing. In this application, clients have the ability to generate graphs, calculate BMI and print their status. 
Data is parsed to connect with a MySQL database. SQL file is not included along with graph images. 

This may not be the most recent version of my Internal Assessment which was submitted to the IB; after recently migrating files, previous and newer versions could be lost.
