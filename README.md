# IB-CS-InternalAssessment
This is the repository for my Computer Science (Higher Level) Internal Assessment for the IB Diploma. 

For my Internal Assessment, I made a Calorie Tracker in Java using Eclipse, with a graphical user interface utilizing Java Swing. In this application, clients have the ability to generate graphs, calculate BMI and print their status. 
Data is parsed to connect with a MySQL database. SQL file is not included along with graph images. 

In the folder lib, are the libraries I used.
In the folder src, are the source files. 
In the IB, we were not required to test and debug. 

This may not be the most recent version of my Internal Assessment which was submitted to the IB; after recently migrating files, previous and newer versions could be lost.
